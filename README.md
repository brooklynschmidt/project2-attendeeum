# Project #2 - Attendeeum: A Group Shared Calendar
[CS 5610: Web Development by John Alexis Guerra Gómez](https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_online_spring_2026/)

# Project Objective
The goal of this project was to get comfortable creating a full stack application using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, and Node. It was a good opportunity to learn how to piece together all of the different moving parts and also work in a team on a larger-scaled project. 

The goal of actual application is to serve as a group-shared calendar that people can share with their friends. This would allow them to RSVP to specific-events and see what other events are going on throughout the week.
